                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Green Society Nepal firmly believes that education is the cornerstone of community development and environmental consciousness. Our Education Program is dedicated to breaking the cycle of poverty by providing educational opportunities to underprivileged children in the Sauraha region.</p>
                    <p>We identify children from marginalized families who are at risk of dropping out of school due to financial hardship. Through our sponsorship program, we cover their school fees, provide them with uniforms, books, and other necessary supplies. This not only ensures they can continue their education but also alleviates the financial burden on their families, allowing them to focus on a brighter future.</p>
                    <p>Education system of Nepal.  Education is the most effective way of changing people’s lives. Our government has 2 different kinds of school system which divides people into two groups.

The Government school system is not competitive and teachers are not motivated. All the subjects are taught in Nepalese, except one, English.

The Private system is good but expensive. Those who study in private schools always have better job opportunities.

Now Green Society Nepal is trying to build a privately-run school.
The GSN have bought the land in Sauraha on which to build a private school for up to 250 children of primary age (6 years to 10 years).

The school will take 50% of children who can pay for their education (how much, Rp’s each child) and 50% of children unable to pay.

and 6-8 well-motivated and experienced Teachers.</p>

    <p>
        There's an enthusiasm in the air at Green Society School as the day begins – the community is learning together, growing exponentially and creating a future in which all will flourish.

Green Society Nepal is seeking $100,000 USD in order to complete financing for the socially groundbreaking private Green Society Public School that will educate children in and around Bachhauli, Chitwan, Nepal. Green Society Nepal has already been guaranteed funding for 20% of our total construction cost. Through local grants and partner funding, Green Society Public School is already self-sustainable after year one, planning to achieve a profit . With your support of our building construction, our success is assured.
    </p>
    <p>
        THE AIM: to provide a quality, equal education for ALL children and to enable them to gain better-paid jobs.


Planning Permission has been given.


US $130,000 is needed to build the whole school,
however $50,000 will be enough to  build 4 classrooms which will immediately benefit the local children.


Who will benefit?: Society as a whole, the local economy, individuals will reach their full potential. Education is a means to eradicate poverty.
